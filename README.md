ASSIGNMENT FOR BRAINSTATION

In this assignment, I assumed the role of a Cybersecurity professional brought in after the incident has occurred. I was provided with a case brief included here. It was my task to prepare a report that outlined key information relating to the incident, along with my own analysis and recommendations.

This assignment was meant to develop my mindset as a Cybersecurity professional and evaluate my ability to extract key information, critically analyze problems, and apply my new Cybersecurity knowledge.
